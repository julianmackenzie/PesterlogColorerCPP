# PesterlogColorer
A command line program written in C++ to add color formats to pesterlogs for mspfa.com

This is a command line program written in less than 24 hours, on very little sleep, college budget taco salad, and two pints of iced sweet tea. I am wiped.

The project was born of need: my girlfriend and I are attempting to create a webcomic together, a project inspired by Homestuck. It is hosted on https://mspfa.com.
What enticed me to create this was the bare-bones page editor that they provide. It was extremely tedious, adding color codes to each chunk of dialog to represent specific characters talking as is done in Homestuck. The tools they give to do this are just enough to get by but not by any means fun or intuitive to use. So, to combat an outdated interface, I decided to write my own!

This makes it much easier, especially for large chunks of dialog, to color the logs quickly. All instructions on how to use the program are built into its interface, and error checking makes it pretty difficult to make mistakes. The only part particularly important that the user understands is the format of the input file, which is also covered inside of the program.

I hope this product aids my fellow creators in making their own fancomics!
